1. Install VirtualBox.

sudo apt-get install virtualbox

2. Install Vagrant.

sudo apt-get install vagrant

The Terminal will indicate that the following new packages will be installed on your machine:

bsdtar curl libruby1.9.1 libyaml-0-2 ruby ruby-childprocess ruby-erubis

ruby-ffi ruby-i18n ruby-log4r ruby-net-scp ruby-net-ssh ruby1.9.1 vagrant

3. Deploy your development environment.

vagrant box add precise32 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box

4. Start Vagrant.

vagrant init

NOTE: The “vagrant init” command sets up a Vagrant environment by placing a Vagrant file in the appropriate directory on your machine.

vagrant up

Once you’ve entered those commands, Vagrant will be installed and fully up and running on your Ubuntu 14.04 machine.
